# High-School-Coding-Projects
A complete collection of all the the coding projects I made in High School. These projects were all developed in Processing which uses java. Many of the projects were small assignments I had for class and thus the code is usually pretty short (there are a few larger projects though)! In order to actually run any of the programs, you need to install processing: https://processing.org/download

To run a project, you can select a proccessing file (they use the .pde extenstion) to open the processing editor and click the run button. 
Alternatively, you can use the command line to run a sketch, but it's not a good utility and the first method is far simpler. You can read about how to run a processing sketch from the command line here: https://www.dsfcode.com/using-processing-via-the-command-line/

Feel free to use any of the code you see! If you dig deep through my projects, some notable things you may find are a space shooter, a break out game, pong, and even more silly things.

I thank my high school teachers for teaching me how to do all of this stuff and I would not be where I am today without any of you!
