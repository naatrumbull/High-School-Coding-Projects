# High-School-Coding-Projects
A complete collection of all the the coding projects I made in High School. These projects were all developed in Processing which uses java. Many of the projects were small assignments I had for class and thus the code is usually pretty short (there are a few larger projects though)! In order to actually run any of the programs, you need to install processing: https://processing.org/download

To run a project from the command line:
```
processing-java --run FILENAME
```
Alternatively, you can select a proccessing file (they use the .pde extenstion) to open the processing editor and click the run button. 

Feel free to use any of the code you see! If you dig deep through my projects, some notable things you may find are a space shooter, a break out game, pong, and even more silly things.

I thank my high school teachers for teaching me how to do all of this stuff and I would not be where I am today without any of you!
